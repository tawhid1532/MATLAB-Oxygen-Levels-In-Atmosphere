## Introduction
Oxygen is everywhere, but at its most basic, it is an element in the form of gas that makes up the Earth’s atmosphere and natural formations. Oxygen gas makes up about 21% of the air in the earth’s atmosphere. It makes up almost 65% of the human body when considered by mass. It makes water when combined with two hydrogen atoms.
    Do you know what the effect of oxygen is in the vast atmosphere around us? 
    At present, we breathe from the atmosphere 100 years ago, what was the status of the atmosphere?
